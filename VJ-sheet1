Question 1.Determining Even/Odd Numbers

Difficulty: Easy
Topics: Basic Programming
Description: Write a program to check whether a number is even or odd.
Example:
Input: number = 4
Output: Even
Explanation: Since 4 is divisible by 2, it is an even number.

Question 2.Checking for Prime Numbers
Difficulty: Easy
Topics: Basic Programming, Number Theory
Description: Write a program to determine if a number is prime.
Example:
Input: number = 7
Output: Prime
Explanation: 7 has no divisors other than 1 and itself, so it is a prime number.

Question 3.Validating Leap Years
Difficulty: Easy
Topics: Basic Programming, Date Handling
Description: Write a program to check if a given year is a leap year.
Example:
Input: year = 2020
Output: Leap Year
Explanation: 2020 is divisible by 4 but not by 100, or it is divisible by 400, so it is a leap year.

Question 4.Finding the Fibonacci Number at a Specific Position
Difficulty: Easy
Topics: Basic Programming, Sequences
Description: Write a program to find the Fibonacci number at a specific position.
Example:
Input: position = 5
Output: 5
Explanation: The Fibonacci number at position 5 is 5 (sequence: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5).

Question 5.Calculating the Sum of Digits of a Number Until Single Digit
Difficulty: Medium
Topics: Mathematical Computations
Description: Write a program to keep summing the digits of a number until a single digit is obtained.
Example:
Input: number = 9875
Output: 2
Explanation: The sum of digits is 9 + 8 + 7 + 5 = 29, and then 2 + 9 = 11, and finally 1 + 1 = 2.

Question 6.Generating a Fibonacci Sequence Using Recursion
Difficulty: Medium
Topics: Recursion, Sequences
Description: Write a recursive program to generate the Fibonacci sequence up to a given number.
Example:
Input: number = 5
Output: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3
Explanation: The Fibonacci sequence up to 5 is generated.

Question 7.Finding the Second Largest Number in an Array
Difficulty: Medium
Topics: Arrays, Sorting
Description: Write a program to find the second largest number in an array.
Example:
Input: array = [10, 20, 4, 45, 99]
Output: 45
Explanation: The second largest number in the array is 45.
